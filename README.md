## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb Open Data to better understand:

1. What are the busiest times of the year to visit Seattle? By how much do prices spike?
2. Is there a general upward trend of both new Airbnb listings and total Airbnb visitors to Seattle?
3. How well can we predict a price of Seattle Airbnb listings? What aspects correlate well to price?

Seattle Airbnb Open Data is available in kaggle. [link](https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/home)
